# Sports-Performance-Analysis
The main aim of this work is to use smartwatches and smartbands to obtain heart rates during and after training, at different times of the day, morning and afternoon, in order to determine the one when sports performance is best. This is because the longer it takes for the heart rate to stabilise after the end of the training session, the lower the Heart Rate Recovery (HRR) will be and consequently worse will be the sporting performance in that period.
